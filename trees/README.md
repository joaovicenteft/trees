# Trees - Data Structures
Tree is made up with nodes or vertices. It is a generalization of a graph.

# BST tree
BST tree is the most basic data structure that uses double recursion, a case of divide and conquer. With the increase of data the tree will be unefficient, to correct this is propose the AVL tree.  
```
gcc BSTtree.c -o BSTtree
```

# AVL tree
AVL tree is a binary search tree with a balanced factor, which avoid the tree having much childrens in a single branch. Uses rotations to balance the tree.
```
gcc AVLtree.c -o AVLtree
```
